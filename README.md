RaidCaller
RaidCaller is a helper addon for World of Warcraft (Classic, 1.12.1 client) designed to assist raid leaders and assistants by providing a quick and easy way to send pre-defined, instructional messages to the raid chat.

It streamlines raid communication, allowing leaders to focus on the encounter mechanics instead of typing out commands.
