# RaidCaller

**Your essential co-pilot for clear and effective raid leading in Vanilla WoW.**

RaidCaller is a lightweight, modern addon for the World of Warcraft 1.12.1 client, designed to streamline communication for raid leaders and assistants. It replaces the need to manually type commands during a hectic boss fight with a simple, powerful, and intuitive interface.

Spend less time typing and more time leading.

## âœ¨ Core Features

* **ðŸ’¬ Instant Raid Calls:** Click a button to instantly send a pre-written, instructional message to either `/raid` or as a prominent `/raidwarning`.

* **ðŸ“š Extensive Phrase Library:** Comes pre-loaded with common, effective phrases for every major boss in Onyxia's Lair, Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, Zul'Gurub, and Ahn'Qiraj (both AQ20 and AQ40).

* **ðŸ§  Smart Dual-Window UI:**

  * **Settings Window:** A clean interface for pre-fight setup. Select the raid, boss, and message type.

  * **Phrases Window:** A separate, compact window showing only the relevant phrases for the current fight. Set up your calls, close the settings, and keep the small phrase list on screen.

* **ðŸ¤– Automatic & Manual Modes:**

  * **Manual:** You have full control to select the raid and boss.

  * **Automatic:** Integrates seamlessly with **BigWigs Bossmods** to detect the active encounter and load the correct phrases for you, automatically.

* **ðŸ”Œ LDB / Minimap Support:** Includes a fully-featured **LibDataBroker (LDB)** plugin. If you use a display addon like Titan Panel, FuBar, or just want a minimap icon, RaidCaller integrates perfectly.

  * Shows current mode and boss at a glance.

  * Left-click to toggle the settings panel.
